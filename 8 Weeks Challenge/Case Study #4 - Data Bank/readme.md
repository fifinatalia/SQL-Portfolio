## **Problem Statement**

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.
Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data worldâ€¦so he decides to launch a new initiative
Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank and customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts.
